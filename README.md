## 1. Project Context<a id = "context"></a>:

Waggle, a startup that makes smart devices for pets. Recently, Waggle has been thrilled by the success of their new Lapdog device, a fitness collar that lets owners track their dog’s steps, alerts them when it’s time for a walk, and even repels fleas! Reviews have been fantastic, sales are growing, and—best of all—the product really works!

This success has led Waggle’s CEO to push for a feline version but there are concerns about its viability. For this reason, the product team distributed 1,000 Lapcat prototypes for field testing. Now, after months of data collection, you have been tasked with delivering a boardroom-ready Power BI report that tells the story of how the Lapcat data compares to findings from the dog collar Lapdog devices. You’re excited because your work will be presented at the highest levels of the company and will either help convince the CEO that Lapcat is the next big thing or a costly mistake to be avoided.
